## Introduction

Teaching has always been one of the most meaningful parts of my journey, not just as a student but as an engineer. Before I ever built projects or deployed systems, I found myself helping classmates understand math, science, electrical engineering concepts, and eventually computer science.

It always felt good to take something I spent time learning and explain it simply to someone else. Helping a concept *click* for someone became just as rewarding as mastering the concept myself.

What I did not realize at the time was that teaching would become one of the most important parts of my own learning. Each time I helped someone, I had to push myself to understand the idea more deeply. If I was learning a topic at the same time as my peers, I would study harder, learn faster, and break concepts down in a way that made sense because someone was relying on me to help them understand it too.

That experience shaped everything that came later.

## Tutoring Electrical Engineering and Computer Science

During my undergraduate years, I naturally stepped into tutoring roles, supporting students in electrical engineering courses, introductory computer science, object-oriented programming, and general math and science.

These were not official positions at first. I was simply helping friends, classmates, and peers who were stuck or overwhelmed. Over time, it became clear that I genuinely enjoyed it.

**I loved this work.**

I loved the challenge of taking a difficult problem and turning it into something approachable, manageable, and even fun.

Eventually, I became a **Teaching Assistant** and **Supplemental Instructor**, specifically supporting undergraduate CS courses. I helped students debug their first programs, understand the basics of logic, absorb the structure of OOP, and build confidence in concepts that once felt intimidating.

These moments reminded me of how far I had come and how far I wanted to help others go.

## Discovering CodePath and Becoming a Tech Fellow

Later in my journey, I took a course with CodePath and immediately connected with their mission: making high-quality CS education accessible, inclusive, and impactful.

I knew I wanted to be part of it.

I joined as a **Tech Fellow**, helping students learn web development, holding office hours, and supporting prospective students working through their technical prework. Many learners came in feeling unsure or overwhelmed, and I loved being the person who could say:

> You’ve got this. Let’s work through it together.

Eventually, I became a **Tech Fellow Manager**, allowing me to support students directly and mentor the Tech Fellows who worked alongside them. I contributed to curriculum feedback, breakout room strategies, engagement structures, and behind-the-scenes operations that help CodePath serve thousands of learners.

This experience strengthened my passion for improving CS education in real, hands-on ways.

## Teaching Kids at CodaKid

Around the same time, I became an instructor at **CodaKid**, teaching young learners (ages 7–14) everything from Scratch basics to Python games and beginner AI concepts.

Teaching kids is a completely different experience. They are curious, fearless, and incredibly imaginative. They ask questions adults would never think of and come up with solutions that feel wonderfully outside the box.

Through CodaKid, I learned how to:

- turn complex concepts into fun explanations  
- break problems into small, understandable steps  
- use visuals, analogies, and storytelling  
- keep learning playful  
- adapt to many different learning styles  

This experience made me a better communicator and a more empathetic engineer.

## How Teaching Made Me a Better Engineer

Teaching has shaped the way I think about engineering in almost every way:

- **Communication:** If you can explain a system simply, you truly understand it.  
- **Debugging:** Helping someone debug teaches you to see code from multiple perspectives.  
- **Collaboration:** Teaching builds patience, clarity, and teamwork.  
- **Problem Decomposition:** Teaching requires breaking down complex ideas into small, digestible pieces.   
- **Mastering Fundamentals:** The more you teach the basics, the stronger your own foundation becomes.

Teaching and engineering support one another. Each skill improves the other.

## A Purpose Bigger Than Code

One of my favorite lines from my graduation speech was:

> My greater mission is to empower the next generation of tech leaders by creating tools, communities, and programs that make computer science more accessible, inclusive, and supportive.

This still feels true today.

My passion for teaching shows up in the time I spend supporting students and also in the projects I choose to build. I love creating tools that help people learn, practice, and grow. Whether I am developing educational platforms like **CodeAgent**, creating CS resources, or mentoring future engineers, empowering others is at the center of everything I do.

Teaching is not just something I do.  
It is part of who I am.

## Final Thoughts

My journey in engineering has never been only about code. It has always been about people — the students who needed help, the classmates who needed clarity, the kids who needed encouragement, and the learners who needed someone to believe in them.

Teaching helped me become a better engineer, a better communicator, and ultimately a better version of myself. It taught me to lead with empathy, curiosity, and purpose.

As I continue growing in my career, I know this for certain:  
**I want to build systems, but I also want to build pathways for others.**

If my work helps someone else discover their potential in tech, then I am exactly where I am meant to be.
