In this post, I’ll walk you through how I built a secure file storage system using **AWS KMS** for encryption, **Django** for the backend, and **PostgreSQL** for metadata storage.

This project taught me how to combine **AWS KMS**, **Django**, and **PostgreSQL** for secure file handling.

Here’s the architecture:

## Lessons learned
- Encrypt files before upload
- Use KMS for key rotation
- Use environment variables for security
